2. Estimations (Time / Value) - planning poker

3. Analysis
	use case description
	use case diagram
	test cases (test scenarios)

4. Design
	Class Diagram (simplified -> no standard getters/setters and no tests)
	*Sequence diagram (for complex cases)
	*activity diagram (atleast for mediocre stuff) *not always needed

5. Implementation
	*Test (no boilerplate getters/setters or autogenerated stuff (equals, hashcode)
	*Code
	JavaDoc (no boilerplate / auto genererated) 
	Code review
	*Buildable / Not broken
	Presentable (output)

PedestrianLight

-> light - pedestrian light class (or multiple classes)
-> timing (3-5 secodns) 
-> prints (shows what is happening)
