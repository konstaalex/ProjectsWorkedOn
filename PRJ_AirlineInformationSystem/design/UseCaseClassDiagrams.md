<a name="registerFlight"></a>  <h3> Register new flight </h3>
<p> The team made desicison to make a class diagram for each use case as it is more clear which classes are being used for the particular use case. In the coaching our it was also empashised to make class diargam in this way as then one class diagram for the whole application looks messy. </p>

<a name="RemoveFlight"></a>  <h3> Remove Flight </h3>
<p> In this Java class diagram, you can see the layers' interaction for the Use Case Remove flight. Here you can see the dependencies from the layers and how they use/implement each other. The Classes we use, are connected by interfaces, therefore we can Isolate them better in a test environment.  </p>
