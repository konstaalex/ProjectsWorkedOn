# PRJ2 - Airline Information System

The purpose of this repository is to document your project work.

***Your group is responsible for the repository structure and content***, but we created some template folders for you. You do not have to stick to this.

## Documentation

Github documentation is part of the communication grade for project 2 (PRJ23). Therefore it is important to make sure to write proper documentation and to write that in a format that can be rendered by Github.
Github supports a multitude of languages for this [purpose](https://github.com/github/markup), however you are only allowed to use:

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - Have a look at the [Github flavored markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html) - Have a look at the [AsciiDoctor cheatsheet](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/)

## Diagrams

In the AADE course you will learn how to develop diagrams with the use of [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/). You are free to use this program also for the diagrams for project 2.

**However** Visual Paradigm creates `binary` files which don't play nice with version control systems (VCS) such as Git. We therefore also recommend to have a look at the following ways of creating diagrams, based on text files (which is what VCSs excel at).

- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) - PlantUml let's you easily create unified modeling languages (UML) diagrams in a text based manner. There is a [VSCode extension available](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) for live previews and exporting of diagrams.
- [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) - Drag and drop editor that works in the browser. There is also a [VSCode extension available](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio). Have a look at [this guide](https://github.com/philip-gai/github-drawio-demo) on how to make sure your images are always up-to-date.

Examples of these diagrams can be found in the [design](/design) directory.

> :warning: **Make sure there is always an image available of all diagrams** (preferably as SVG)
